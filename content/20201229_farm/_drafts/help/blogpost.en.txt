## Formatting text

When making a profile or post, there are some guidelines you should follow in order to custom format content and also for the styling to be consistent throughout the website. This type of formatting is called "Markdown" and is pretty simple. Here are some of the most important rules:

### Line breaks
Press enter to create a line break. If you want a new paragraph, press enter twice:

```
My first line
My second line

Another paragraph
```

### Headlines
Add a hash "#" to the front of the text that you want to be a headline:

```
# Headline 1
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

## Headline 2
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

### Headline 3
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

#### Headline 4
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
```

### Lists
Add a dash "-" or number to the front of the text that you want to be in a list:

```
- Homer
- Marge

1. Bart
2. Lisa
```

### Links
The simplest way to create a link is to wrap the URL in "<" and ">":

```
<obinahopfarm.com>
```

### Images
The simplest way to add an image is by the following:
(image: myawesomepicture.jpg)

```
